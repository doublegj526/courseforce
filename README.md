# Course Force

A web user interface geared towards helping Harvard undergraduates find the best major given the courses they have taken so far/are currently taking. In other words, it is dedicated to the individuals who are in college and don't really know what they are doing and finding the least number of required courses needed to graduate. Currently, the UI only allows to choose from 7 concentrations, which are given as follows:

Mathematics
Earth and Planetary Sciences
Physics
Computer Science
Economics
Music
Statistics

The database of courses is current as of Spring of 2015, but does not yet have the updated database of courses recently posted on my.harvard as of Fall 2015. Happy coding!
